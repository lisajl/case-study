This part is located at the back of the fridge, beneath the bottom panel. It is connected directly to 2 water supplies, a wiring harness, and your inlet water tube. Minerals and sediments can build up over time and cause a blockage in your inlet valve. They can also cause the valve to stick open, leading to an overflow of water. If this part is malfunctioning, water flow to your appliance could be compromised. Check for small ice cubes or a lack of ice cubes/water, as this is an obvious sign the part is damaged. The water inlet valve must be replaced if the solenoids no longer have continuity or the valve has internal blockage. Test your water inlet valve with a multimeter. You can test both the water dispenser side and the ice maker side. The part measures approximately 3 inches long and 2.75 inches wide and is constructed of plastic and metal.

    "description": "This dishwasher door hinge cable assembly connects the door to the spring. The door hinge cable and the door spring apply tension to the door to prevent it from dropping open too quickly. This part contains two plastic pieces which are approximately 2 inches in length by 3/4-inch in width, as well as a rope portion that measures approximately 8 inches in length. When beginning this repair, be sure to use caution when replacing the door hinge cable. The spring to which the door hinge cable attaches is under tension and could snap. This part is sold individually.",
