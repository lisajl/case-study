It is responsible for spraying water onto the dishes that are placed in the top rack. It is located beneath the top rack and consists of several small openings or nozzles through which water is propelled with high pressure. When the dishwasher is in running, water is pumped through the spray arm, and the force of the water causes it to rotate, ensuring that water is distributed evenly across the dishes for effective cleaning. If the arm become damaged or clogged with debris, you may notice difficulties cleaning your dishes properly, rattling or scraping sounds and reduced overall efficiency.",

If your shelf retainer bar has become disconnected, a damaged end cap could be the cause. To remove the end cap, first unhook the release tab on both ends of the retainer bar. Slide out the bar and the end caps, and slide out the defective cap. Now, simply replace the end cap and snap the bar with end caps back in place on the refrigerator door. This part is made of white plastic and is sold individually.",
