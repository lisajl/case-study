    "description": "The Defrost Timer (Defrost control) acts like a clock by switching on the defrost heater circuit after a predetermined amount of compressor run time. This allows the defrost circuit to clear the evaporator of ice or frost to maintain proper airflow. If this part is not working, it can lead to temperature increases in your refrigerator. If the compressor circuit fails, no cooling will take place; if the defrost circuit isn't activated, ice will quickly build up on the evaporator coils and reduce airflow and efficiency. If the timer doesn't advance or if the contacts have no continuity, the timer will need to be replaced. This part is located inside of the control housing on most models, and is approximately 3 inches long and 2.5 inches wide. This part is constructed of plastic and metal, and comes in white. It features 1 defrost timer, along with all necessary mounting hardware and installation instructions",

Over time, the sprayer head may become clogged due to a build of debris and soap residue, or it may also be damaged by a falling item. If the sprayer head is faulty, you will likely notice that your dishes are not cleaned properly after a cycle, and they have spots of leftover soap residue. It is important to replace the sprayer head to keep your dishwasher running efficiently.",

The function of this part is to hold the micro switches and the light socket in the freezer dispenser section in place. Its measurements are roughly 9 inches long and 5 inches high, and this model comes in white. The tools you will need in order to do this repair include a Phillips screw driver, a quarter-inch nut-driver, and a pair of needle-nose pliers. If your ice dispenser is not working properly, your bracket could be the problem.",

    "description": "This pin acts as a sleeve for the French door spring in a refrigerator. This is a genuine OEM part that is sold individually and works with the spring within the door mullion to seal the door shut. If you need to replace the sleeve, check whether the spring in the door is still intact as well. You will only need to replace one spring sleeve pin per door, as there is only one sleeve on the upper part of the spring. To remove the spring and replace the mullion, do so with a set of needle-nose pliers and lift the lower side of the spring to easily pull it out, then you can replace the sleeve.?",
