    "description": "This is a drain pump assembly for various compatible models of dishwashers, that is responsible for draining the water from the dishwasher after every cycle. This drain pump assembly is made of plastic and fits within the sump assembly, which controls the flow of water into the drain. This drain pump assembly is a genuine OEM part and is made of a high-quality plastic but is sold as an individual component without any other parts, like its drain pump check ball which works within the pump to prevent water from backwashing into the pump, as well as the drain pump cover. If you notice your dishwasher is not draining or has a lot of water buildup at the bottom of the sump assembly, this filter may be damaged, clogged or broken, and in need of a replacement. To replace this pump assembly, you will only need a Philips-head screwdriver, but should start by removing your dishwasher racks. Then, pull up on the lower spray arm, and drain trap to remove them. Next, rotate the spray arm support and pull that up to remove it, at which point you can remove the base and filter for the drain pump. With those out, you can use your Philips-head screwdriver to disconnect and remove the cover and drain pump assembly. With the pump removed, you can inspect it or install the new drain pump assembly, with the same hardware as before. Then it is as simple as reassembling the rest of your dishwasher, ensuring each connection point is fastened tightly.",

When the ice maker is empty, the arm will be down.

To replace this arm, unplug your appliance and remove the ice making assembly, then pull the levelling arm out of the assembly and place the new one. Consisting of a long, angled metal arm and a plastic flap, this level arm is a genuine OEM part that is compatible with a wide-range of refrigerators and icemakers and measures at approximately 9-inches by 4.5-inches.",

    "description": "The function of the Refrigerator Water Inlet Valve (Triple Solenoid Water-Valve, Water Valve, Water Inlet Valve, Refrigerator Water Inlet Valve Assembly) is to release water from the supply line when activated, and send it through to your water dispenser or ice maker in your refrigerator. The water inlet valve is located at the back of the refrigerator, and connects to the water supply. The valve can break from material fatigue or normal use. If your water inlet valve is malfunctioning, you could be getting a lack of water to the inside of your refrigerator. Your ice maker may not produce cubes or your water dispenser may not work. The water inlet valve must be replaced if the solenoids no longer have continuity or the valve has internal blockage. This valve measures approximately 7 inches long and 4.5 inches wide, and is constructed of plastic and metal. It comes in blue, and includes the valve and mounting bracket.",
