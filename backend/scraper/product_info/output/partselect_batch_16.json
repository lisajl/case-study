    "description": "This part is the replacement carrier roller for your dishwasher. It is also known as the wheel support. It is made of gray plastic and is approximately 5 inches by 2 inches. The carrier roller supports the wheels on your upper dish rack so it can slide in and out of the dishwasher efficiently. This part has been redesigned by the manufacturer. This part can now be used on the right or left side of the rack. Because it is made of plastic, the roller can occasionally crack and break, and when this occurs, it will need to be replaced. If you notice that your dish rack is having difficulty sliding in and out, you should check to see if the roller is damaged. This is an OEM part from the manufacturer and it is sold individually. The roller itself, is replacement part number WD12X26146. The cover is no longer needed when replacing the rack carrier kit.",

This filter helps prevent these particles from clogging the pump or recirculating back onto the dishes. Signs of a faulty micro filter include poor cleaning performance, slow drainage, stagnant water at the bottom of the tub, and loud and unusual noises when the dishwasher is running. It is recommended to clean the filter once a month for optimal performance.",

    "description": "When the igniter reaches a high enough temperature, these coils (Coil Valve, Dryer Gas Valve Coil Kit, Dryer Valve Coil Kit, Gas Valve Solenoid) work together to open the gas valve and allow the gas to enter the burner. This is a safety mechanism to ensure that there are no unsafe buildups of gas inside your appliance. The coils are attached to the dryer gas valve. If the dryer does not heat or heats intermittently, the coil may not be opening the gas valve. Both coils must be operational for the valve to open. No continuity would indicate a defective coil, but they can be intermittent and fail when they get hot. Both coils should be replaced when one of them is broken. This part can break as a result of material fatigue from normal use. This part measures approximately 1 inch in diameter and 1 inch in height, and is constructed of plastic and metal. It comes in black/beige. This part features a 3-terminal boost/hold coil and a 2-terminal secondary coil",
