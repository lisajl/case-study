If you find the dish rack is causing the door to not close properly, it may be due to the part being worn out or damaged. All you need to complete this repair is a small flat blade screw driver. Simply pop out the cap with a smaller flat-blade screwdriver and snap the new one into place. If the rear cap needs to be replaced you will need to remove both front caps and slide the rack completely off for full access. It is important to note that this part is sold individually, and more than one may be required, depending on your repair. An inexpensive part, it can be a good idea to purchase several at a time to have on-hand when needed.",

    "description": "This OEM mid spray or center wash arm assembly distributes water and detergent in your dishwasher during the wash cycle. It has small nozzles that spray water onto your dishes and is located between the lower and upper rack. A broken assembly will result in weak water flow and ineffective dishwashing. It may also display signs of damage such as cracks, breaks, or missing nozzles. Additionally, a malfunctioning assembly can cause imbalanced water flow, potentially leading to damage to other dishwasher components such as filters or pumps. Prompt replacement is necessary to ensure proper dishwashing performance and prevent further damage. To install this to your appliance, you will need to snap its mounting bracket onto the rack before attaching the arms onto it. This replacement part is sold individually.",
