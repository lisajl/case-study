Check your user manual and model number to ensure this model is right for you. This version is plastic and metal and comes in gray/blue. We recommend you wear work gloves to keep your hands safe when installing and disconnect power to the appliance. You will also want to make sure that you turn off the water supply to your dishwasher. From here, you will want to open the dishwasher, pull out the lower rack and set it aside. Remove the lower wash arm. On each side of the bottom of the spray arm, there are small locking tabs that can be pushed aside using a flathead screwdriver. Once released, the spray arm can easily be pulled off the dishwasher. Put the new lower wash arm in place and push it down to lock it in. Ensure it is spinning freely and does not hit the heating element. Return the lower dish rack into place and then close the dishwasher door.",

    "description": "This dishwasher door gasket and strike kit is an essential component for maintaining a watertight seal around the dishwasher door and ensuring proper latch operation. The gasket prevents water leakage by forming a tight seal between the door and the tub, while the strike works as a mechanical actuator for the door switch and provides tension for a secure seal. Over time, wear and tear may cause tears, gaps, or cuts in the gasket, leading to leaks. This genuine OEM replacement kit is compatible with select models of Whirlpool, KitchenAid, Maytag, Jenn-Air, Amana, Inglis, and Magic Chef dishwashers. For proper installation, unplug the dishwasher or turn off the circuit breaker to ensure safety. Refer to the installation guide or video for step-by-step instructions, and wear protective gloves while replacing the gasket and strike.",
