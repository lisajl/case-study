This door seal is used in two-door fridges and therefore one door seal is required for each door. The seal prevents cold air from escaping and warm air from entering the refrigerator, to maintain a consistent temperature inside. The seal is located around the perimeter of the refrigerator door. Over time, the door seal can wear out, become cracked, or lose its elasticity. A faulty door seal will lead to increased energy consumption, inconsistent temperatures, and potential spoilage of food. To replace the door seal, simply peel off the old seal, and clean the sealing area. Align the new seal along the door perimeter and press it firmly into place to create a tight seal. Each order only comes with one door seal, therefore if both of your door gaskets are faulty, you will need to order two of these.",
