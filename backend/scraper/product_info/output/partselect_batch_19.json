    "description": "This is a bimetal defrost thermostat for your refrigerator. It stops the fridge from overheating during the defrost cycle by protecting the evaporator. This clip-on thermostat will sense the temperature increase in the evaporator during the defrost process, and will cycle the defrost heater off after the ice or frost is melted. The most common reasons for needing to replace this part are if your unit is leaking, has inconsistent temperatures (too hot or too cold), you are seeing buildup of ice, or your appliance is running too long.",

The filter media is carbon black and reduces leads, some pharmaceuticals, and fifty other contaminates. It is 2 inches deep, 6 inches high, 2.25 inches wide and weighs approximately 1 lbs. When it comes time to replace the filter, first discard the old one by turning it to the left to remove. It will release itself when it has been turned far enough. Installation instructions are quick and simple but can vary slightly depending on if it is a bottom-freezer, side-by-side or multi-door bottom-freezer model. Refer to the user instructions for you filter. Do not forget to reset the filter change indicator if applicable. In bottom-freezer and side-by-side models this is done by pressing and holding the RESET WATER FILTER bottom for three seconds. On a multi-door bottom-freezer model, press the button underneath the Confirm Filter Change message while the water is dispensing. On select models this reset is done automatically once a new filter is installed.",
