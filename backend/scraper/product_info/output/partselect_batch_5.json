    "description": "This package contains one carbon activated filter for refrigerators with Pure Air Ultra II filtration systems. The air filter cleans the air and absorbs strong odors from fragrant foods, such as onions, garlic, seafood, and over-ripe fruits and vegetables. By absorbing these unpleasant smells, it will also improve the flavor of your ice cubes. This is a simple repair that does not require tools for installation or removal. Start by removing the plastic wrap on the new filter, remove the cover from the housing inside the refrigerator, remove the old filter, place the new filter into the housing, and close the cover. Depending on the model of your appliance, you may need to reset the filter reminder. This part is OEM official, guaranteeing a smooth install and proper fit.",

    "description": "This water filter (Whirlpool EveryDrop Refrigerator Water Filter, Single Turn Filter) purifies water going to the water dispenser and sometimes the icemaker as well. This part should be replaced if it is causing reduced water flow or just replaced periodically per the owner manual. Replacing this water filter may fix a noisy or leaking fridge, a fridge that is not dispensing water (or reduced flow rate), and an ice maker that is not making ice at all, or not making enough ice. This filter is white, sold individually and measures 8 inches by 3 inches in diameter. This water filter has been updated by the manufacturer. It may appear different but will still function the same. It is sold individually.",
