It can be located in either the freezer compartment near the evaporator coils or in the fresh food compartment near the airflow channels, depending on the model. If you notice issues like excessive icing in the freezer, inadequate cooling in the refrigerator, temperature fluctuations, or error messages on the display panel, it indicates a potential problem with the thermistor. Since your fridge will not be able to maintain the desired temperature, this results in food spoilage, inefficient cooling, and potential damage to the cooling components. To replace the thermistor, disconnect it from the connector plug or wiring harness and remove any mounting brackets or clips using a screwdriver if necessary. Remember to consult your user manual to determine the required number of thermistors, as they are sold individually as OEM replacement parts.",

    "description": "The purpose of the light switch in your refrigerator is to automatically turn on the light when the door is opened. If the light does not come on automatically when you open the door, the contacts inside the light switch may be burned out, meaning it is time to replace the switch. This package contains both the new light switch and a small plastic spacer. To complete this repair, you will need to remove the control panel section of your refrigerator. The only tools you will require for this repair are a 1/4-inch nut driver and maybe a small flat blade screwdriver. Be sure to disconnect the power source from the refrigerator before completing this repair.",
