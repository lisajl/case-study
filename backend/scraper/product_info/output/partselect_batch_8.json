    "description": "This crisper cover front support is used to keep the crisper shelf in place and may need replacing if the door will not open or close. This white, OEM part measures roughly 1 inch in diameter and can be used for the front and the rear support, as designed by the manufacturer, and mounts to the inside cabinet wall. Replacing this part is an easy repair, and will require a small flat blade screwdriver, a putty knife, and a soft hammer. Remove the crisper and shelf from the refrigerator before replacing the support. The crisper cover front support is held in place with a locking pin. To remove the old part, you will first need to push the pin into the interior of the cabinet using the screwdriver, and then you can pull the support out with a putty knife. If you cannot get the pin out you can use a flat-blade screwdriver to push it down and out of sight and it will not harm anything in your refrigerator After removing the pin and attaching the new support, simply use the soft hammer to lock the new pin in place.",

It ensures leak-free operation and maintains proper water flow during dishwashing. Signs of a broken or worn-out gasket include poor or inconsistent water flow in the dishwasher, resulting in dirty dishes even after a cycle. Additionally, a faulty gasket may cause water to drip or spray around the faucet connection or under the sink, potentially leading to water damage. To remove your existing gasket, you will need to locate it within the back panel of the appliance with the help of your user manual. Detach the faucet adapter from the hose by untwisting it. With a flathead screwdriver or pliers, pry the coupler gasket from your appliance. Please note that this replacement part is sold individually.",

    "description": "This manufacturer-approved air filter system for refrigerators eliminates odors and any impurities. It does this by neutralizing and removing odor-causing molecules. For best results, it is important to change the filter every 6 months to ensure that food is kept fresh, and the humidity is controlled. This part measures about 7 inches wide and 5 inches deep. Follow installation instructions provided by the manufacturer when installing this part to ensure accurate results and further guidance. Remember to unplug the refrigerator from the power source before starting this project. The air filter may be located in different places depending on your appliance, but is usually on the inner right or left side. See your manual for exact location. Our customers rated this as a very easy repair that takes only a few minutes; just locate and remove the old air filter and insert the new one to complete the repair, which requires no tools.",
