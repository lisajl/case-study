Description: The Rack Slide End Cap is a white one-inch plastic part which replaces the end cap for your dishwasher rack, preventing your rack from sliding too far. If you find the dish rack is causing the door to not close properly, it may be due to the part being worn out or damaged. All you need to complete this repair is a small flat blade screw driver. Simply pop out the cap with a smaller flat-blade screwdriver and snap the new one into place. If the rear cap needs to be replaced you will need to remove both front caps and slide the rack completely off for full access. It is important to note that this part is sold individually, and more than one may be required, depending on your repair. An inexpensive part, it can be a good idea to purchase several at a time to have on-hand when needed.

Description: This lower spray arm assembly in your dishwasher distributes water and detergent during the washing cycle by spinning around and spraying water in different directions.

It is important to replace a damaged arm assembly as your dishes will not get cleaned properly, and they will still have dirt on them even after a wash cycle. It can also cause the dishwasher to have a bad smell because of leftover food residue. To remove your existing arm assembly, you will need to release its locking mechanism before lifting it out of your appliance. Please be informed that this OEM-verified part is sold individually.

Description: This is a drain pump assembly for various compatible models of dishwashers, that is responsible for draining the water from the dishwasher after every cycle. This drain pump assembly is made of plastic and fits within the sump assembly, which controls the flow of water into the drain. This drain pump assembly is a genuine OEM part and is made of a high-quality plastic but is sold as an individual component without any other parts, like its drain pump check ball which works within the pump to prevent water from backwashing into the pump, as well as the drain pump cover. If you notice your dishwasher is not draining or has a lot of water buildup at the bottom of the sump assembly, this filter may be damaged, clogged or broken, and in need of a replacement. To replace this pump assembly, you will only need a Philips-head screwdriver, but should start by removing your dishwasher racks. Then, pull up on the lower spray arm, and drain trap to remove them. Next, rotate the spray arm support and pull that up to remove it, at which point you can remove the base and filter for the drain pump. With those out, you can use your Philips-head screwdriver to disconnect and remove the cover and drain pump assembly. With the pump removed, you can inspect it or install the new drain pump assembly, with the same hardware as before. Then it is as simple as reassembling the rest of your dishwasher, ensuring each connection point is fastened tightly.

Consisting of a long, angled metal arm and a plastic flap, this level arm is a genuine OEM part that is compatible with a wide-range of refrigerators and icemakers and measures at approximately 9-inches by 4.5-inches.

If your water inlet valve is malfunctioning, you could be getting a lack of water to the inside of your refrigerator. Your ice maker may not produce cubes or your water dispenser may not work. The water inlet valve must be replaced if the solenoids no longer have continuity or the valve has internal blockage. This valve measures approximately 7 inches long and 4.5 inches wide, and is constructed of plastic and metal. It comes in blue, and includes the valve and mounting bracket.

Manufacturer Part Number: 00713448
Manufacturer: Bosch
Made For: Bosch
Price: 274.69
Description: This door seal, also known as a door gasket, is a flexible strip made of rubber that acts as a seal between the refrigerator door and frame. This door seal is used in two-door fridges and therefore one door seal is required for each door. The seal prevents cold air from escaping and warm air from entering the refrigerator, to maintain a consistent temperature inside. The seal is located around the perimeter of the refrigerator door. Over time, the door seal can wear out, become cracked, or lose its elasticity. A faulty door seal will lead to increased energy consumption, inconsistent temperatures, and potential spoilage of food. To replace the door seal, simply peel off the old seal, and clean the sealing area. Align the new seal along the door perimeter and press it firmly into place to create a tight seal. Each order only comes with one door seal, therefore if both of your door gaskets are faulty, you will need to order two of these.

Description: This authentic OEM coupler gasket creates a watertight seal between your dishwasher hose and the faucet or the water inlet. It ensures leak-free operation and maintains proper water flow during dishwashing. Signs of a broken or worn-out gasket include poor or inconsistent water flow in the dishwasher, resulting in dirty dishes even after a cycle. Additionally, a faulty gasket may cause water to drip or spray around the faucet connection or under the sink, potentially leading to water damage. To remove your existing gasket, you will need to locate it within the back panel of the appliance with the help of your user manual. Detach the faucet adapter from the hose by untwisting it. With a flathead screwdriver or pliers, pry the coupler gasket from your appliance. Please note that this replacement part is sold individually.

Description: The hose clamp is used to hold the water hose in place which will prevent the hose from leaking water. Sometimes the clamp may lose its ability to latch on, causing a leaking washer. For the installation, you will need a flat head screw driver to replace the clamp and a drill to access the screws to remove the front of the washer. Be careful if you do not have specific clamp pliers as the clamp could fly off. Once the front of the washer has been removed, take a quick look for water damage or any obvious signs of where the leak is coming from. If it is not obvious, run water to test.

Description: The Lower Spray Arm is used in your dishwasher to spray water and clean your dishes. If broken there will be visible damage or your dishes may no longer be cleaned properly. If your spray arm is broken (due to general wear or high heat), it should be replaced. Your lower spray arm will be located at the bottom of your dishwasher tub. Check your user manual and model number to ensure this model is right for you. This version is plastic and metal and comes in gray/blue. We recommend you wear work gloves to keep your hands safe when installing and disconnect power to the appliance. You will also want to make sure that you turn off the water supply to your dishwasher. From here, you will want to open the dishwasher, pull out the lower rack and set it aside. Remove the lower wash arm. On each side of the bottom of the spray arm, there are small locking tabs that can be pushed aside using a flathead screwdriver. Once released, the spray arm can easily be pulled off the dishwasher. Put the new lower wash arm in place and push it down to lock it in. Ensure it is spinning freely and does not hit the heating element. Return the lower dish rack into place and then close the dishwasher door.

Manufacturer Part Number: W10542314
Manufacturer: Whirlpool
Made For: Whirlpool, Kenmore, Maytag, Amana
Price: 57.96
Description: This dishwasher door gasket and strike kit is an essential component for maintaining a watertight seal around the dishwasher door and ensuring proper latch operation. The gasket prevents water leakage by forming a tight seal between the door and the tub, while the strike works as a mechanical actuator for the door switch and provides tension for a secure seal. Over time, wear and tear may cause tears, gaps, or cuts in the gasket, leading to leaks. This genuine OEM replacement kit is compatible with select models of Whirlpool, KitchenAid, Maytag, Jenn-Air, Amana, Inglis, and Magic Chef dishwashers. For proper installation, unplug the dishwasher or turn off the circuit breaker to ensure safety. Refer to the installation guide or video for step-by-step instructions, and wear protective gloves while replacing the gasket and strike.
