Manufacturer Part Number: W10822278
Manufacturer: Whirlpool
Made For: Kenmore, Whirlpool, Amana, KitchenAid
Price: 35.85
Description: The Defrost Timer (Defrost control) acts like a clock by switching on the defrost heater circuit after a predetermined amount of compressor run time. This allows the defrost circuit to clear the evaporator of ice or frost to maintain proper airflow. If this part is not working, it can lead to temperature increases in your refrigerator. If the compressor circuit fails, no cooling will take place; if the defrost circuit isn't activated, ice will quickly build up on the evaporator coils and reduce airflow and efficiency. If the timer doesn't advance or if the contacts have no continuity, the timer will need to be replaced. This part is located inside of the control housing on most models, and is approximately 3 inches long and 2.5 inches wide. This part is constructed of plastic and metal, and comes in white. It features 1 defrost timer, along with all necessary mounting hardware and installation instructions

Description: This nozzle assembly, commonly referred to as a sprayer head or spray arm, is an authentic replacement part supplied directly by LG for use in LG dishwashers. The nozzle assembly can be found at the bottom of the dishwasher tub. It is responsible for spraying water onto the dishes and utensils inside the dishwasher using a series of nozzles that release pressure water. Over time, the sprayer head may become clogged due to a build of debris and soap residue, or it may also be damaged by a falling item. If the sprayer head is faulty, you will likely notice that your dishes are not cleaned properly after a cycle, and they have spots of leftover soap residue. It is important to replace the sprayer head to keep your dishwasher running efficiently.

Part Name: Hinge - French Door DA61-03230B
PartSelect Part Number: PS4143931
Manufacturer Part Number: DA61-03230B
Manufacturer: Samsung
Made For: Samsung
Price: 8.23
Description: This is a French door hinge that is compatible with various models of refrigerators and is used to control the mullion (long plastic strips) on the inside portion of the French doors. If you notice that your doors open and the mullion either moves freely or is stuck, this hinge needs to be replaced immediately to prevent issues with frost buildup, energy efficiency and temperature fluctuations. Replacing this hinge is quite simple, and you will only need a flathead and Philips-head screwdriver to do it. First, remove the screw covers from the securing screws for the mullion. Unscrew and remove the securing screws with your Philips-head screwdriver, and then pull the mullion up and out carefully to dislodge it from the fridge door. Near the middle of the mullion, disconnect the wire harness to remove the mullion completely. Remove the hinge cover with a flathead screwdriver to expose the hinge, and then carefully remove and replace the old hinge onto its attaching spring. Then you can simply reassemble the rest of the door assembly, along with the hinge cover and wire harness.

Description: This water access valve, also known as a water inlet valve, is an authentic OEM replacement part used in dishwashers. The valve controls the flow of water into the dishwasher. It is responsible for allowing water from the household water supply to enter the dishwasher tub during the wash cycle. The valve is controlled by the electronic control board, which signals it to open or close based on the selected cycle and water level requirements. Once the dishwasher is filled to the appropriate level, the water inlet valve closes to prevent any further water from entering the tub. If the valve is faulty, you will likely experience water leakages, difficulties filling dishwasher, and poor cleaning results. This part is commonly associated with the E15 error code on dishwashers.

Price: 30.77
Description: When the igniter reaches a high enough temperature, these coils (Coil Valve, Dryer Gas Valve Coil Kit, Dryer Valve Coil Kit, Gas Valve Solenoid) work together to open the gas valve and allow the gas to enter the burner. This is a safety mechanism to ensure that there are no unsafe buildups of gas inside your appliance. The coils are attached to the dryer gas valve. If the dryer does not heat or heats intermittently, the coil may not be opening the gas valve. Both coils must be operational for the valve to open. No continuity would indicate a defective coil, but they can be intermittent and fail when they get hot. Both coils should be replaced when one of them is broken. This part can break as a result of material fatigue from normal use. This part measures approximately 1 inch in diameter and 1 inch in height, and is constructed of plastic and metal. It comes in black/beige. This part features a 3-terminal boost/hold coil and a 2-terminal secondary coil

Refer to your user manual and model number to ensure this is the correct part for you. This kit includes both the right and left side end caps, as well as the pins that will hold them in place. To replace an end cap, remove the three screws holding it in place. Then, remove the pin and end cap, replacing the old end cap with the new end cap. In the past, the left and right end caps were sold separately, but the part has been updated and now includes both sides. The part is sold as a kit, and unfortunately, as such none of the parts are available individually.

Description: This circulation pump is a genuine OEM replacement part designed for use in dishwashers. It is responsible for circulating water throughout the dishwasher during the wash and rinse cycles. The circulation pump draws water from the dishwasher tub, pressurizes it, and then distributes it to the spray arms, which spray the water onto the dishes to remove food particles and debris. The circulation pump may fail due to several reasons such as an electrical fault, a blockage in the pump impeller, motor failure, or physical damage. A faulty pump will result in water leakages, unusually loud noises during use, reduced water circulation, and poor cleaning performance.

Part Name: Refrigerator Ice and Water Filter MWFP
PartSelect Part Number: PS8746144
Manufacturer Part Number: MWFP
Manufacturer: GE
Made For: General Electric, Hotpoint, Kenmore
Price: 68.83
Description: This OEM ice and water filter fits side-by-side and bottom-freezer GE models. The most common reason you would need to change this part is if you have never updated your model and it is no longer filtering your water. This also may lead to your refrigerator not dispensing water or ice properly. Manufacturers recommend you change your filter every six months to ensure it properly filters impurities. Depending on the model, a red light might also indicate that the filter is due for a replacement. Note: As per the manufacturer, this is an updated water filter. If you have never installed the updated part or your old model was made by Culligan, you may need the adapter to install the filter. See related parts. This filter is located inside the refrigerators upper right corner. It is common for water to drip from the dispenser when being changed so place a cloth underneath before you begin this repair. To remove the filter, turn it to the left until it releases without pulling down. Fill the new filter with tap water to prepare it. Position the new filter into the holder taking note of the arrows. The arrow on the front should be facing out. Gently push up on the filter and turn it to the right to secure it. Do not over-tighten. To release air in the system run 1-1/2 gallons of water through it. If your model has a reset button, press and hold this for a few seconds to reset it.

Description: This long harness thermistor kit is what helps monitor and regulate the temperature inside your refrigerator. It can be located in either the freezer compartment near the evaporator coils or in the fresh food compartment near the airflow channels, depending on the model. If you notice issues like excessive icing in the freezer, inadequate cooling in the refrigerator, temperature fluctuations, or error messages on the display panel, it indicates a potential problem with the thermistor. Since your fridge will not be able to maintain the desired temperature, this results in food spoilage, inefficient cooling, and potential damage to the cooling components. To replace the thermistor, disconnect it from the connector plug or wiring harness and remove any mounting brackets or clips using a screwdriver if necessary. Remember to consult your user manual to determine the required number of thermistors, as they are sold individually as OEM replacement parts.

PartSelect Part Number: PS16217433
Manufacturer Part Number: XWFE
Manufacturer: GE
Made For: General Electric
Price: 79.69
Description: This water filter is found in the rear upper-right corner of the interior of the refrigerator. If your model has a replacement indicator light it will turn red to signal the need for a replacement. If your model does not have an indicator light, the filter cartridge should be replaced every six months or earlier if you notice a decrease in the flow of water from the dispenser. The filter media is carbon black and reduces leads, some pharmaceuticals, and fifty other contaminates. It is 2 inches deep, 6 inches high, 2.25 inches wide and weighs approximately 1 lbs. When it comes time to replace the filter, first discard the old one by turning it to the left to remove. It will release itself when it has been turned far enough. Installation instructions are quick and simple but can vary slightly depending on if it is a bottom-freezer, side-by-side or multi-door bottom-freezer model. Refer to the user instructions for you filter. Do not forget to reset the filter change indicator if applicable. In bottom-freezer and side-by-side models this is done by pressing and holding the RESET WATER FILTER bottom for three seconds. On a multi-door bottom-freezer model, press the button underneath the Confirm Filter Change message while the water is dispensing. On select models this reset is done automatically once a new filter is installed.

Description: This water inlet valve is usually located behind the lower kickplate panel in either the right or left corner of the dishwasher. The attaching solenoids on the valve open and close according to the desired amount of water needed. The water inlet valve on your dishwasher supplies water to the dishwasher. If your dishwasher is leaking because it has overflowed, the water inlet valve may be the cause. If your dishwasher continues to fill above the heating element, try opening the door latch to see if it stops filling. If it continues to fill, you have a defective inlet valve that will need to be replaced.

Description: The door spring puts tension on the dishwasher door though the hinge. This keeps it from falling or dropping abruptly when opening and closing. Please note: The spring for either side of the door is sold individually. If you see that your dishwasher is leaking, the door will not close or open properly, or it gets stuck, then replacing the spring could be a solution to these symptoms. During installation, remember there is potential for the door spring to snap if it is under too much pressure. For safety precautions, make sure you unplug the dishwasher from the power source before beginning your project.

The capacitor helps the compressor kick on and off while maintaining a constant temperature to keep things frozen in your freezer. The start relay boosts the compressor, and then shuts off as soon as the motor gets up to speed and the overload provides extra protection against excessive temperatures.

Description: This drum support roller is used for square-ported model clothes dryers. This part is sold individually; however, rollers tend to wear at the same rate, so it is suggested that both should be replaced at the same time. It has a metallic bearing in its center. The drum support roller holds the drum in place while it rotates on the support wheels. You may have a faulty or damaged roller if your dryer will not start or tumble, takes too long to dry clothes, or starts making loud noises. Customers have ranked this repair as easy and should take 15-30 minutes to complete.
